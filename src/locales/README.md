Hi!

Thanks for thinking about translating iroase.

Some things to keep in mind if you are submitting translations:

Rules
---

- For now, please only edit the locale JSON files in your pull requests. Don't touch any other code.

Guidance
---

- Text should be stylized in lowercase if the language allows (if you were texting a friend in this language, whatever the equivalent of "lowercase" would be. It should otherwise be grammatically correct. Of course, there is nuance to this, so use your own discretion.)

- If the language is gendered and you are referring to other users, please use neutral pronouns (the equivalent of singular they). e.g. this might be done in Spanish using the plural form, or perhaps "-e" for adjective endings.

- If you have any questions / feedback / font issues / layout problems / whatever, please don't hesitate to open an issue. I've tried my best to handle RTL and non-Latin scripts, but alas I can't check these as I don't speak other languages.
